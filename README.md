# OneJourney Technical Showcase

## Getting Started

First install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see "Hello, World!".

## Before you get started

This is a freeform technical showcase, we want to see what you can do rather than tell you how to do it - so please approach this in a way which best showcases your technical ability and craftsmanship!

There are a few things already setup to save you some time but feel free to use alternatives if you need to.

- `styled-components` is setup and ready to go.
- `sanitize.css` is included to save you needing to reset anything.
- There is an endpoint at `/api/rooms` that you can use for some mock data.

## The challenge

We’d like you to create a single page that displays a list of rooms available at a hotel. How you approach this is up to you, show us what is important to you when crafting an application.

If you’d like to really show off your skills you could you create a price filter that would allow you to send a list hotels within a price certain price bracket.
